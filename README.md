# Stt-Tts
To achieve this :
1. I've use the IBM watson & Vscode & importing some libraries..etc. 
2. From the IBM watson I've create a new service which is stt, and saved the apikey & region, and use it latter to change it in the code.
3. I've download folder watson-streaming-stt to use it as a base..
4. I've downloads the dependencies.
5.And also by the help of python i could make the tts, starting with importing some packages 
then getting to know how to write the code..etc.
